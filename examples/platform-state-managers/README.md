# Platform State Manager: An LWC State Manager Example

This example provides a minimal implementation of a state manager. It demonstrates how to define a state manager, how to use it to retrieve Salesforce metadata and data, and how to display state manager data in your LWC user interface.

This example is packaged as a Salesforce DX project, and is intended to be run in a Salesforce Developer or Sandbox org.

The interesting portion of this example is [the JavaScript file for the `detailPanelStateManager` component](force-app/main/default/lwc/detailPanelStateManager). It implements a minimal state manager that is capable of retrieving record data for a given record ID. It first retrieves layout metadata to get a list of fields for the record and record type, and then retrieves the record data. Copious comments guide you through the implementation. 

The remainder of the example lets you enter a record ID, and displays a plain text representation of the retrieved record data.

## Salesforce DX Project: Next Steps

If you want to experiment with `platform-state-managers` in your own Salesforce org, as a Salesforce DX project, whatâ€™s next? 

First, we recommend you limit use of state management to Developer or Sandbox orgs while the feature is in Developer Preview. 

Next, here are some documentation resources to get you started.

### How Do You Plan to Deploy Your Changes?

Do you want to deploy a set of changes, or create a self-contained application? Choose a [development model](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/vscode/en/user-guide/development-models).

### Configure Your Salesforce DX Project

The `sfdx-project.json` file contains useful configuration information for your project. See [Salesforce DX Project Configuration](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_ws_config.htm) in the _Salesforce DX Developer Guide_ for details about this file.
